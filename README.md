# Customer-Segmentation-system-
Customer segmentation is the practice of grouping your customers according to shared traits, such as behaviors or demographics, so your sales or marketing teams may more successfully engage with those customers.


## Goal of the project
This project's goal is to carry out a customer segmentation analysis for a company that sells bicycles and cars. Create an RFM Model to perform customer segmentation. Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis is a behavior-based method for segmenting clients. On the basis of their prior purchasing transactions, it groups the customers. The client segment was separated into 11 groups for this investigation. In order to increase sales revenue for the organisation, the analysis will assist in identifying which consumer categories should be targeted. Tableau is used to create a "Sales Dashboard for Customer Segmentation," and Python is used to evaluate and analyse the data quality.
